        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The aim of this paper is to analyze the perceptions 
            of the transport service providers on the barriers in urban freight transport and the 
            restrictions imposed on freight vehicles, identifying which urban freight transport 
            policies can improve this activity in Brazil. Principal component analysis allowed 
            us to identify which are barriers in urban cargo transport and the restrictions imposed 
            on freight vehicles. In addition, we evaluated freight policies that can improve the 
            activity using probabilistic preference. We obtained the database from a web-based 
            survey of transport service providers in Brazil. The results indicate that the urban 
            freight vehicle restriction is related to congestion and availability of loading 
            and unloading areas. The freight vehicle restriction is a result of the lack of 
            information and data. The theft of cargo significantly impacts urban freight transport. 
            Transport service provider company perceptions indicate an urban mobility plan as the
             most-required freight policy to improve freight mobility. To reduce the barriers to 
             urban freight planning, an understanding of the problem involving the stakeholders 
             is needed. To do so, the challenge is to change the culture in the transportation 
             planning process by integrating various actors to create an urban logistics plan that
             generates opportunities for the city.<Laurem</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Infrastructure is the fixed installations that allow a vehicle to operate. 
            It consists of a roadway, a terminal, and facilities for parking and maintenance. For rail, pipeline, road
            and cable transport, the entire way the vehicle travels must be constructed. Air and watercraft are able
             to avoid this, since the airway and seaway do not need to be constructed. However, they require fixed
              infrastructure at terminals.</p>

              <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Terminals such as airports, ports, and stations, are locations where passengers and freight can be 
            transferred from one vehicle or mode to another. For passenger transport, terminals are integrating 
            different modes to allow riders, who are interchanging between modes, to take advantage of each mode's 
            benefits. For instance, airport rail links connect airports to the city centres and suburbs. The terminals
             for automobiles are parking lots, while buses and coaches can operate from simple stops.[15] For freight,
             terminals act as transshipment points, though some cargo is transported directly from the point of
              production to the point of use.</p>
